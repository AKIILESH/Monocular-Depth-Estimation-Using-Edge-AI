# Monocular-Depth-Estimation-Using-Edge-AI
This project leverages deep learning to estimate pixel-wise depth maps from a single RGB image or live webcam feed in real-time. Built with modularity and efficiency in mind, it can be extended with other depth models or integrated with object detection frameworks for advanced vision applications.

# 🧠 Real-Time Monocular Depth Estimation

Real-time depth estimation from a single RGB image using deep learning. This project uses a pretrained monocular depth model to predict pixel-wise depth maps, allowing machines to understand the 3D structure of their environment using just one camera.
